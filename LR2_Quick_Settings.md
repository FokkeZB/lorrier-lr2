LR2 Quick Settings
==================

Preconfigured LR2 since version 2.1.0 is running on Debian (versions may vary)
which contains web administration environment.

1.  Connect the antenna to your LR2. Do not use this unit without antenna or
    appropriate attenuator connected.

2.  Connect your LR2 using enclosed POE adapter to your network. Default network
    setting is Static IP: 192.168.1.2. Booting of the LR2 takes about 60
    seconds.

3.  Set your Routerboard password. To change Routerboard password or to change
    network setting, follow the instructions in
    [/routeros/routerboard\_configuration.md](https://github.com/lorriercom/lorrier-lr2/blob/master/routeros/routerboard_configuration.md)
    file.

4.  Set your BBG password: Use SSH connection on port 2222 (default setting
    192.168.1.2:2222). Default login: username: *root* / password: *lorrier*. In
    the command line type *passwd root* and *passwd debian* to change your
    password.

5.  Type *192.168.1.2* (or your new IP setting) in your web browser and
    authorize the safety certificate to open web administration environment.

6.  Enter your login. The default login: username = *admin* / password =
    *lorrier*

7.  Choose your Packet Forwarder or network server service in the
    Settings-\>Forwarder window. The MAC address information (primarily for
    Loriot.io service) can be found in Dashboard-\>Device Info. After Packet
    Forwarder change, you may need to reboot your Gateway in Dashboard window.

8.  If needed, you can change your Gateway ID in the Settings/Gateway ID window.

9.  Set your web administration password in the Preferences window.

**NOTE:**

-   Be sure LR2 is able to connect to the internet. The web administration
    environment gets the network server services from the
    /github.com/lorriercom/lorrier-lr2/servers.json file. When the internet
    connection is missing, the page refresh would last for quite long time and
    there is only TTN Basic packet forwarder, TTN Poly packet forwarder and
    Loriot.io choice active. Obviously, in such a case LR2 can not send the
    payloads to network server.

-   For maximizing network security we strictly recommend you to set [IP address
    restrictions](https://github.com/lorriercom/lorrier-lr2/blob/master/routeros/routerboard_configuration.md)
    on your routerboard to avoid possible cyber attacks.

-   Since version 2.1.1, BBG access is protected by fail2ban (login brute force
    attack protection). You have 3 login attempts, then you have to wait for 15
    minutes to next try.
